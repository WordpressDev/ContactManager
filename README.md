# Contact Manager

**Contact Manager** is a Node.js implementation of Dan Wellman's [Building a Contacts Manager Using Backbone.js tutorial](http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/javascript-ajax/build-a-contacts-manager-using-backbone-js-part-1/) on net.tutsplus.com.

### Usage

I have broken the tutorial up into separate parts to correspond to the parts in the original tutorial.

There are separate branches: [part1](http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/javascript-ajax/build-a-contacts-manager-using-backbone-js-part-1/), [part2](http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/javascript-ajax/build-a-contacts-manager-using-backbone-js-part-2/), [part3](http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/javascript-ajax/build-a-contacts-manager-using-backbone-js-part-3/)
as well as version tags on the master branch: v0.1, v0.2, v0.3
that correspond to the tutorial.

You can view each version in the master branch by checkout that version:
    ```git checkout v0.3```

or by checkout out a branch:
    ```git checkout part3```

I'll update this repo as I progress through the rest of the tutorial.
